					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
					<p>I have 7 years of experience in the service industry in both front facing customer service and kitchen roles. I am a quick learner who is motivated to take on new challenges and learn new skills. I am currently working towards my CompTIA A+ certification, and am currently pursuing degrees in both Information Technology and History at UCF.
<p></p> I have also been a computer hardware enthusiast for my whole life, having built several computers for my own personal use. I have also been called upon by friends, family, and instructors to help diagnose, repair, and troubleshoot computer issues. This is work I have enjoyed greatly as a hobby, and I am seeking to transition to doing this professionally.</p>
